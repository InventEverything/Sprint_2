### B3: Assign a Bug to a Developer

I implemented the AssignToDeveloper method, a feature that allows users to assign bugs to developers efficiently

# How It Maps to the User Story:
Â· User Story: As a user, I want to assign a bug to a selected developer.

# Implementation:
- The method checks input validity to ensure a developer is provided.
- It assigns the bug to the selected developer, updating its property.
- Prevents reassignment if a bug is already assigned

# Tests
1. AssignToDeveloper_WhenBugAlreadyAssigned_ReturnsAlreadyAssignedMessage
Purpose: Ensures that if a bug is already assigned to a developer, reassigning it returns the correct message.
Validation: The method should return "This bug is already assigned to a developer." when an attempt is made to assign it again.

2. AssignToDeveloper_WhenDeveloperNameIsNullOrEmpty_ReturnsInvalidInputMessage
Purpose: Verifies that an invalid developer name (null, empty, or whitespace) results in an appropriate error message.
The methodd should return "invalid input" when given a blank developer name

3. AssignToDeveloper_WithValidDeveloperName_UpdatesAssignToDeveloperProperty
Purpose: Ensures that a valid developer name correctly updates the AssignedToDeveloper property of the Bug object.
Validation: The assigned developer should match the input name after execution.

4. AssignToDeveloper_WithValidDeveloperName_ReturnsSuccessfulAssignmentMessage
Purpose: Confirms that assigning a bug with a valid developer name returns a success message
